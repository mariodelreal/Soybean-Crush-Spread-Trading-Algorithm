# Soybean-Crush-Spread-Trading-Algorithm

This strategy was created during a Financial Market research course at Carthage College during the spring 2018 semester. The course was led by professor Alex Lau and we worked with RCM Alternatives from Chicago to develop an implementation of a mean reversion trading algorithm for the soy bean crush spread. There were three other students in the course with majors in finance and accounting and I used my knowledge from computer science to put the theory into code.
